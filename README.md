# Raytracing-2D

A simple 2D raytracing visualization made with [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) including walls (black) and mirros (grey).  
Mirrored light rays are colored in blue to distinguish them from normal ones.  
This project was heavily inspired by [The Coding Train](https://thecodingtrain.com/), especially his [video on raytracing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOEi6T2mtHo)  
To run the code just open `index.html` in a webbrowser.
